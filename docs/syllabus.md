### Pre-readings (Flipped Classroom) 

This course, as well as other MSCS courses at the Vancouver campus of Northeastern University, will be taught using a pedagogical technique known as the Flipped/Hybrid classroom.  This approach makes the most of our precious class time by eliminating the standard lecturing model, where course material is introduced to the students during class, usually via a lengthy PowerPoint presentation.  In our Flipped/Hybrid classroom, you will come to class having already completed several readings where you will be introduced to the course material.  During class, you will apply your understanding of these core concepts through carefully-chosen problems and activities, which will enable you to solidify your knowledge.  

Flipped/Hybrid classrooms require much more focus and preparation time, for both the instructor and the students.  After all, it is much easier for the instructor to read a set of pre-prepared slides and for the students to passively observe and listen.  But on our campus, we will devote our class time to the computational thinking process: resolving obstacles, developing conceptual understanding, communicating solutions supported by evidence, and creating efficient algorithms that solve our problem.  Through this process, you will better develop your confidence, creativity, and critical-thinking skills, preparing you to become computer scientists (not just programmers).

In order for this course to be a meaningful learning experience, you will need to come to each class well-prepared, with all assigned readings and videos complete.  This emphasis on pre-class work is the reason why our class meets for only 2 hours each week, compared to other four-credit courses at Northeastern that meet for 3.25 hours each week. If you do not complete the pre-class work, you will have a hard time following the in-class activities, which will make it that much harder for you to successfully complete the course deliverables.

I have designed this course so that you will be spending approximately 12 to 20 hours per week on all activities relating to this course (i.e., pre-class work, attending class, all assessments).

### In-Person Attendance

If you join class in-person, you are strongly encouraged to bring your laptop or phone to class so that you can participate in the activities.

Most lectures will feature interactive activities and/or polls that support the material being presented. You must be present in class to complete the activity or take the poll (participating in an online activity while not attending the synchronous session will be considered academic dishonesty and will be treated harshly). Each instructor may have a different style for assigning participation grades, but historical grading information suggests that each style results in a similar overall grade distribution. 

Students are expected to attend classes regularly, complete assessments, and submit reports and other work at the times specified by the instructor. Students who are absent repeatedly from class will be evaluated by faculty responsible for the course to ascertain their ability to achieve the course objectives and to continue in the course. Instructors may include, as part of the semester's grades, marks for the quality and quantity of the student's participation in class.

> [!ATTENTION]
> Students are expected to attend class in person but may use a one-time “remote attendance token” if necessary. To use this token, notify the instructor and TA at least 24 hours in advance. Failure to do so will forfeit the token. Once the token is used, any further absences will be marked as in-person absences.

If you must miss class, regardless of the reason for your absence, it is **your** responsibility to catch up on the material you have missed and obtain the notes from a classmate (not from your instructor or TAs). Failing to attend the class meetings may have a detrimental impact on your ability to pass the course. If a graded activity takes place during class or lab, it is your responsibility to turn it in by the deadline whether you are in class or not. 

Please don’t be late. You are an essential part of the class. Your participation is an essential part of the class. If you are late, please be courteous to others when entering.

**Be present when you are attending class.** Please do not distract yourself from the class by doing other activities such as phone calls, email, facebook, chat/IM/texting, games, web surfing – unless it has a direct connection to the class activity.

### Classroom Etiquette

The classroom principles that we will follow in the classroom are transparency, equity and inclusion, participation, active dialog, and constructive critique. Students are expected to support each other, learn from each other, and help each other grow. Students have the responsibility to conduct themselves in ways that will help them learn, yet that will not disrupt other students’ learning. While each student will be working closely with their team members, you are also expected to engage with your classmates in a respectful, kind, and helpful manner.

In the class, we encourage asking questions, sharing ideas, and engaging in discussions related to the class topics. Sometimes discussions may steer away from the course content, and the course instructor will reserve the right to re-direct it back on track.

Giving and receiving feedback is one of the core activities in this class. When giving and receiving feedback, it is important to keep in mind that we give feedback because we want all projects to succeed. Our feedback will highlight parts that work well but also point out aspects that can be improved. The feedback should not be taken personally or seen as an attack on students' knowledge or capabilities. Thus, we will learn a craft of constructive feedback and practice it in the class regularly.

| C-    | 65.00% – 68.99%  |
| F     | Less than 65.00% |

### Grade Solicitation Policy

Requests for grade adjustments (especially final course grade) based on non-academic reasons are not appropriate and are considered unprofessional. Examples include, but are not limited to, statements such as "I need this grade," "I deserve a higher grade" or any similar personal circumstances.

Students are expected to meet the academic requirements of the course as outlined in this syllabus. Soliciting grade changes undermines the integrity of the evaluation process and may result in a negative impact on your final grade.

If you have concerns about your performance, you are encouraged to seek feedback early and make use of available resources, such as office hours and course support services, to address any challenges proactively.

## Important Notes

- Students must attain a passing grade on all components of the course in order to obtain a clear pass (C or better). 
- Professionalism is expected at all times. This includes respectful communication with your peers and instructors, as well as timely submission of assignments and participation in group work. Students who do not meet the standards of professionalism will be subject to penalties.

## Importance of Group Work and Participation Policy

Group work is a vital component of this course, reflecting the collaborative nature of real-world projects. Working effectively in a team is essential for your professional development. It’s important to approach group tasks with respect for each other’s ideas and perspectives, and to ensure that everyone contributes equitably.

Your team's performance in the course project plays a large part in your individual mark. In addition, in your individual mark the peer component relates to your contributions and participation in your team. 

To maintain fairness and academic integrity, all group members are expected to contribute equally to the project. Here’s how we handle group participation:

1.	**Peer Resolution**: When non-participation issues arise, the first step is for group members to address and attempt to resolve them internally. It’s important to document these efforts—such as meeting notes, emails, or messages on platforms like Slack or Discord—in case further action is required.
2.	**Reporting Non-Participation**: If internal resolution efforts do not succeed, the concerned student(s) should schedule a meeting with their TA. However, it’s important to note that without sufficient evidence of attempts at peer resolution, the TA will not proceed with scheduling the meeting. During the meeting, if scheduled, students should present the documented evidence and discuss possible next steps with the TA.
3.	**TA Intervention**: Following the consultation, the TA may involve other teaching team members to ensure that the workload is fairly distributed and completed by all group members. If additional actions are needed, the teaching team will directly engage with the specific group or individual members to determine the best course of action.

Non-contribution or “free riding” is not acceptable in this course. Every student is expected to contribute meaningfully to group projects. **Repeated failure to participate will result in penalties.** 

## Northeastern and Course Policies

### Late Deliverables

All course items (e.g. assignments, projects, etc.) have a specific due date and time. Your work is late if it is not turned in by the deadline. In-class activities, exams and final project will not be accepted late. Take-home assignment and lab submissions will be accepted only up to 24 hours after the deadline with a flat 25% penalty regardless of how late it is. After 24 hours, the submission will not be accepted and you will receive a grade of 0 for that item.
 
Make-up assessments (including assignments, project, exams) will not be given. Sometimes life gets in the way of schedules. Sickness or other unplanned or extraordinary events happen and will be dealt with individually. It is your responsibility to ensure your situation is known to the instructor as soon as reasonably possible. You are accountable for being heard, which means you need to ensure that the instructor heard you.
 
While "life happens," poor planning by you does not count. And definitely do not wait to discuss gray areas. For example, an interview opportunity arises (good!): you should not wait until the day before the assignment is due to let us know that you could not complete the assignment because you had to prepare for the interview. That would be considered poor planning. Good planning would be to alert the TA or Instructor that you got the interview and, while you hope to finish the assignment, there is a concern. Then when you don’t finish on time, it’s clear that you planned your time and that will be taken into consideration. These "good planning" situations will be considered individually as per the instructor's discretion.

In the extraordinary circumstance (e.g., medical or family emergency) that you are prevented from completing and submitting components on time, or fully participating in your group's work, we may allow late turn-in. In this case, contact your TA or the course instructor well in advance of the deadline (a usual expectation would be at least 24 hours in advance). At the discretion of the instructor considering the circumstance, a penalty may still be imposed of a mark reduction.

### Academic Integrity

Academic honesty is essential to the continued functioning of Northeastern University as an institution of higher learning and research. All Northeastern students are expected to behave as honest and responsible members of an academic community. Breach of those expectations or failure to follow the appropriate policies, principles, rules, and guidelines of the University with respect to academic honesty may result in disciplinary action. 

Students are expected to be familiar with and adhere to the [University Academic Integrity guidelines (OSCCR)](https://osccr.sites.northeastern.edu/academic-integrity-policy/).

*Failure to comply with any of these responsibilities, either knowingly or through negligence, will also be considered an act of plagiarism and subject to the same penalties.*

These rules are intended to help you get the most out of your education and to clarify the line between honest and dishonest work. **The course instructor reserves the right to ask you to verbally explain the reasoning behind any answer or artifact that you turn in and to modify your final grade based on your answers.** It is vitally important that you turn in work that is your own.  If you have had a substantive discussion of any course item  with a classmate, then be sure to cite them in your report. If you are unsure of what constitutes "substantive", then ask the teaching team or err on the side of caution. Refer to the specific course policies for more details as each may have specific requirements of working in groups or individually. The default is that all work is individual unless explicitly stated otherwise.

### Artificial Intelligence (AI) / ChatGPT Policy

The use of AI tools such as ChatGPT is permitted with specific guidelines (subject to audits). Please refer to the [AI Policy](ai-policy.md) for more information.

### Remarking Policy

As a teaching team, we strive to provide fair and accurate assessments of your work while also providing as much feedback. We encourage you to review the feedback and spend your time/energy where it serves you the most which will be learning from past mistakes and self-improvement. While you reserve your right to ask for a re-grade, we find debating grades an incredible drain on course staff time and energy and prevents us from serving students well and focusing on most important aspects of the course. 

If you feel a course item has been incorrectly assessed you may request that the item be remarked. However, before making a remarking request, please complete the following steps:

1. Review the marking rubric and feedback/comments (if applicable).
2. Schedule a meeting with the TA to discuss the feedback and marking.
3. If you still feel the marking is incorrect, you may request a re-marking.

#### Request a Remarking

Requests must include a written letter for the re-marking and be submitted to the course TA/instructor within 5 business days from receiving the mark or a deadline specified by the TA/instructor, whichever comes first. The request must be signed and submitted via email. 

> [!WARNING]
> Course grades are considered final on a rolling basis (e.g. as we progress through the semester). After the regrading request deadline (e.g., 5 business days or deadline set by TA/instructor), grades will be considered final and no further requests will be accepted. Students are encouraged to review their grades and ask questions within the specified time frame. Inquiries after the deadline will not be considered.

The re-marking request will be reviewed by the teaching team and if accepted, the item will be re-marked in its entirety by both the course instructor and the marking TA. This may result in a higher, unchanged, or lower mark overall which will be final. 

#### Grade Solicitation Policy

Requests for grade adjustments (especially final course grade) based on non-academic reasons are not appropriate and are considered unprofessional. Examples include, but are not limited to, statements such as "I need this grade," "I deserve a higher grade" or any similar personal circumstances.

Students are expected to meet the academic requirements of the course as outlined in this syllabus. Soliciting grade changes undermines the integrity of the evaluation process and may result in a negative impact on your final grade.

If you have concerns about your performance, you are encouraged to seek feedback early and make use of available resources, such as office hours and course support services, to address any challenges proactively.


### Accommodations

The goal is that every student should be able to participate in this course. If you require any special accommodations, let the teaching team know immediately so that we can work out appropriate arrangements.

Students who have disabilities who wish to receive academic services and/or accommodations should visit the [Disability Access Services (DAS)](https://disabilityaccessservices.sites.northeastern.edu) or call (844) 688-6287.

If you have already done so, please provide your letter from the DAS to the instructor early in the semester to arrange those accommodations.

### Course Feedback

Your opinions are very important to me. All students are strongly encouraged to use the [Teacher Rating and Course Evaluation (TRACE) system](https://www.northeastern.edu/trace), to complete your course evaluations. A reminder about TRACE should arrive via email about two weeks before the end of the course.

In addition, I will be asking for your feedback at least once, about halfway through the semester. However, if you have concerns about the course, do not wait until you are asked. Please schedule a meeting with me, and we will discuss your concerns then.

### Wellness and Mental Health Support

As a graduate student, you may experience a range of challenges including significant stress, difficult life events, mood changes, excessive worry, or problems with eating and/or sleeping. If you or anyone you know is struggling, we strongly encourage you to seek support. Northeastern University provides several services and resources to support the overall wellness of students. 

To access support, you can [book a Wellness Consultation](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/WellnessConsult@northeastern.onmicrosoft.com/bookings/) with the Vancouver Wellness Program Specialist.
