# Seminars

As part of our course, we will have a series of seminars on various topics related to the course. These seminars will be led by student groups and will involve a mix of lecture, discussion, and hands-on activities. The goal of the seminars is to provide students with an opportunity to explore topics in more depth and to engage with the material in a more interactive way. The seminars will be graded based on participation, engagement, and the quality of the presentation.

All student groups will be responsible for leading at least one of the sessions as the "seminar lead." For the seminar lead exercise, you only focus on the readings for the week that you signed up for. You will prepare a brief presentation and try to engage other students in discussion - What is the important idea? Does everyone agree or disagree? What may be other perspectives on the issue? How does it relate to our ongoing class assignment/project? In the past, some students have tried to create some interactive exercises, play games, etc. -- it's up to you! 

## Rough Timeline
As a rough idea of the seminar structure (you can modify this as you see fit):
- 15-20 minutes: Presentation of the main ideas from the readings
  - Review the assigned readings for the week
  - Summarize the main points
  - Highlight any key concepts or ideas
  - You can also show a short (>6 minutes) video from youtube to help reinforce the main ideas
- 30-40 minutes: Hand-on activity 
  - Prepare a hands-on activity that will help the class engage with the material
  - Make sure the activity is well-defined and has clear instructions
  - The activity should be fun, engaging, and educational
- 15-20 minutes: Class discussion
  - Use the activity to prompt discussion between the students
  - Ask questions to get the class talking
  - Try to get everyone involved
- 10-15 minutes: Wrap-up and final takeaways presentation
  - What did we learn?
  - What are the implications for our ongoing class work?
- 5-10 minutes: Peer Assessment (provided by the instructor)
  - Each student will be asked to provide feedback on the seminar 
  - This feedback will be used to grade the seminar

 
## Tips for Discussion Leads

You are strongly encouraged to schedule a meeting with your TA prior to your discussion lead date, to review your slides and planned activity. You don't need to have everything finalized for this feedback meeting, but it's best if you bring at least a rough draft of your slides and a clear outline for your activity. This feedback is meant to help you deliver the best possible discussion activity and avoid some common pitfalls.

- Arrive at least 10 minutes early to class on your seminar day to make sure that everything works properly.
- Don't try to reiterate all of the content from the week's readings. 
- Break your activity into well-defined chunks that should take a specific amount of time.
- Include instructions as part of your slides, so the class will have something to refer to while they participate in the activity.
- Reach out to the instructor if you need help printing materials or setting up the classroom in a specific way.
